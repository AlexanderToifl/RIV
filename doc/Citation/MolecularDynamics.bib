abstract = {The reverse nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD) method calculates the shear viscosity of a fluid by imposing a nonphysical exchange of momentum and measuring the resulting shear velocity gradient. In this study we investigate the range of momentum flux values over which RNEMD yields usable (linear) velocity gradients. We find that nonlinear velocity profiles result primarily from gradients in fluid temperature and density. The temperature gradient results from conversion of heat into bulk kinetic energy, which is transformed back into heat elsewhere via viscous heating. An expression is derived to predict the temperature profile resulting from a specified momentum flux for a given fluid and simulation cell. Although primarily bounded above, we also describe milder low-flux limitations. RNEMD results for a Lennard-Jones fluid agree with equilibrium molecular dynamics and conventional nonequilibrium molecular dynamics calculations at low shear, but RNEMD underpredicts viscosity relative to conventional NEMD at high shear.},

@article{Kirova2015,
abstract = {Viscosity and diffusion are chosen as an example to demonstrate the universality of diagnostics methods in the molecular dynamics method. To emphasize the universality, three diverse systems are investigated, which differ from each other drastically: liquids with embedded atom method and pairwise interatomic interaction potentials and dusty plasma with a unique multiparametric interparticle interaction potential. Both the Einstein–Helfand and Green–Kubo relations are used. Such a particular process as glass transition is analysed at the simulation of the aluminium melt. The effect of the dust particle charge fluctuation is considered. The results are compared with the experimental data.},

@article{Mayr2003,
abstract = {Mechanisms of radiation-induced flow in amorphous solids have been investigated using molecular dynamics computer simulations. It is shown for a model glass system, CuTi, that the radiation-induced flow is independent of recoil energy between 100 eV and 10 keV when compared on the basis of defect production and that there is a threshold energy for flow of approximately 10 eV. Injection of interstitial- and vacancylike defects induces the same amount of flow as the recoil events, indicating that point-defect-like entities mediate the flow process, even at 10 K. Comparisons of these results with experiments and thermal spike models are made.},
